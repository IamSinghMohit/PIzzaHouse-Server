# Pizzeria server

This is the part of my project called **Pizzeria**.

- It consists of one admin dashboard to manage products and another client-site in which customers can place orders. There were two separate applications, so I needed to create a separate server which can handle the load of both.

- [Pizzeria-server](https://github.com/MohitNishad/pizzeria-server)
- [Pizzeria-client](https://github.com/MohitNishad/pizzeria-client)

If you want to run this server locally just provide the required environment variabled specified in .env.example.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
